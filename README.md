Added some functionality to improve one chip functionality.


# esp8266-deauth
Multi target De-Auth attack implementation for ESP8266 module.

Projected was created in Arduino IDE v. 1.6.7.
Support for ESP8266 was added with Board Manager. Look here: https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino
I used version 2.1.0-rc2 with edited user-interface.h. Basically I took declaration for 'wifi_send_pkt_freedom' function from higher version of SDK (1.5.0) and paste it into SDK 1.3.0 (because I can see this function present in binaries)

Disclaimer: I am not pretending to create ultimate final solution. It works, in general, on devices I have tested. Main problem is to cover 14 channels with one RF module (*). But I hope this code can give you a quick start for your own experiments.
